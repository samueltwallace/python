 \htmlp{They review six studies testing how well depressed people can smell things. Most use something called “The Sniffin’ Sticks Test” (really!) where people are asked to say which of two sticks has an odor; the strength of the odorous one is then decreased until the subject can no longer consistently get it right. This determines olfactory threshold – how sensitive the subject’s smell is. Depressed subjects did marginally (but significantly) worse on this test than controls (6.31 ± 1.38 vs. 6.78 ± 0.88; P = 0.0005) – I think this corresponds to an effect size of about 0.2. They also do a couple more tests to see if depressed people are worse at identifying odors and get similarly small results. Also, some } \htmla{https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/57612757/j.neuroscience.2010.05.01220181022-20862-xfclgm.pdf}{neuroimaging studies} directly correlate depression and olfactory bulb volume, and find that olfactory areas of depressed people’s brains shrink. 
 \htmlp{Next they look at three studies of people who have various known respiratory diseases that impair sense of smell, and see how many of them are depressed. The answer: lots! Normosmics (people with a normal sense of smell) have an average score of 5 on the Beck Depression Inventory. Anosmics (people with no sense of smell) have an average score of 14. Hyposmics (people with weak sense of smell) are in between. This seemed true independent of respiratory disease level (ie it’s not just that having a worse respiratory disease makes your smell worse } \htmli{and} makes you more depressed).
 \htmlp{The two most common diseases studied were chronic rhinosinusitis and post-upper respiratory infection olfactory dysfunction. One of the studies, } \htmla{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676804/}{Jung, Lee, & Park (2014)}, compares them. They find that 40\% of CRS patients are depressed, vs. 76\% of PURIOD patients, a significant difference (also, both much higher than the ~5-10\% of depressives in the general population). They note that CRS involves a gradual loss of smell, and PURIOD a sudden loss of smell, and that maybe people adjust to gradual loss better than sudden.
 \htmlp{We can easily come up with alternative hypotheses. You can never actually control for confounders properly, and having a respiratory disease sounds depressing. Also, the sorts of people who have respiratory diseases probably differ from the rest of the population in various ways. Biologically, they might have worse immune systems, or end up with worse oxygenation and chronic infections, or just be generally sickly. Sociologically, they might be poorer, or have worse diets, or more comorbidities. Sinus problems themselves are linked to depression for a bunch of reasons, probably relating to the sinus being so closely linked to the brain that sinus inflammation screws up your brain chemistry. Also, most chronic diseases have high depression rates – sickle cell anemia (chosen kind of at random) is 44\%. }
 \htmlp{There really aren’t that many causes of anosmia that are 100\% exogenous and have no chance at all of contributing to depression themselves. But animal researchers can take Gandhi’s advice and become the exogenous cause they wish to see in the world. } \htmla{https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2014.05.013}{Yuan and Slotnick (2014)} discuss experiments where researchers remove the olfactory bulbs of rats. These rats tend to consistently become depressed. That seems like pretty strong evidence to me.
 \htmlp{So why would depression reduce olfactory acuity? And why would reduced olfaction cause depression?}
 \htmlp{Maybe depression reduces olfactory acuity because it reduces sensory acuity in general. We already know that } \htmla{https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-quirky-brain-how-depression-may-alter-visual-perception}{depression decreases visual contrast}, causing the world to literally look washed-out and gray. If I’m reading  \htmla{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20547422}{this study} right, it claims depression also decreases auditory threshold – ie depressed people are less able to hear very quiet sounds. I can’t find similarly good studies on taste or touch, although they should be easy to do. If anyone knows any studies on eg two-point discrimination in depressed vs. non-depressed subjects, let me know. If not, this would be an easy project that a college psychology student could do in a few weeks, and it would add to our understanding of this subject. But right now I think the evidence is consistent with a general decline in perceptual abilities. This fits my understanding of depression as a systemic disorder – the low mood is the most noticeable symptom, but you’re also getting everything from poor digestion to worse hearing. Probably this is because whatever is affecting the emotional centers of the brain is affecting the lower parts of the brain (and nervous system?) too.
 \htmlp{Is the opposite of this true? Does any form of decreased sensory acuity cause depression? I’m leaning toward no. } \htmla{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428930/}{This study} claims to find that myopia is linked to depression, but the association is so weak that I take it as a strike against the hypothesis.  \htmla{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/1835392}{These}  \htmla{https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6449-2}{two} studies find hearing loss is associated with depression, but it’s still pretty weak and it could easily be because poor hearing hurts your opportunities to socialize. I’m most struck by discussion of  \htmla{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromacy}{monochromacy}, ie total colorblindness, which absolutely fail to mention depression at all. If I’m going to be splitting hairs about how depressed people see slightly duller colors, the lack of any excess depression in people without color vision seems pretty important. Blind and deaf people have pretty high rates of depression, but being blind or deaf is really hard and I don’t want to draw too many conclusions there. Overall it doesn’t seem to me like decreased sensory acuity causes depression full stop, though I could be wrong. This would mean that loss of smell is unique in its emotional effects.
 \htmlp{The sense of smell is pretty emotionally salient. Everyone always says that “smell is the sense most linked to memory” – though I can’t figure out exactly which study discovered it and whether it considered (for example) how reliably seeing a picture of my mother reminds me of my mother. Body odor seems to be closely linked to } \htmla{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odour_and_sexual_attraction}{who we’re attracted to}. Smell is responsible for all taste sensation beyond sweet/salty/sour/bitter/umami, and eating food is one of life’s most visceral pleasures. From  \htmla{https://www.fifthsense.org.uk/psychology-and-smell/}{fifthsense.org.uk}:
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{Anosmia sufferers often talk of feeling isolated and cut-off from the world around them, and experiencing a ‘blunting’ of the emotions.  Smell loss can affect one’s ability to form and maintain close personal relationships and can lead to depression.  An important issue here is the fact that smell loss is invisible to all but the patient; how would you know that you had met an anosmia sufferer unless they themselves told you?  This is one of the reasons, alongside the general lack of understanding of the impact that smell has on our lives, why anosmia has never received much attention – you really do not know what you have got until it is gone.}
 \htmlp{But also, Yuan and Slotnick’s rat paper gives a more biological explanation. The olfactory bulb is the beginning of pathways that stimulate many other parts of the brain. When it’s removed (and presumably also when it just never gets any incoming stimuli) it stops doing that, and the downstream parts of the brain shrink. For some reason this also causes decreased brain-wide synthesis of serotonin, maybe because the olfactory bulb is a net positive stimulus on the raphe nuclei. Sure, sounds like the kind of thing that might cause depression.}
 \htmlp{What does this imply about treating depression?}
 \htmlp{SSRI antidepressants probably } \htmla{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053629}{decrease sense of smell} as an immediate side effect. Awkward. But they seem to improve sense of smell long term as part of their general treatment of depression. In studies fluoxetine (Prozac)  \htmla{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0701-5}{causes nerve growth} in the olfactory bulb after a few weeks. Does that suggest a story where SSRIs work by improving smell? Probably not – more likely they work by [a cascading system of effects involving] causing nerve growth more generally, and the olfactory bulb benefits along with everything else.
 \htmlp{Could you treat depression through improving olfactory sensitivity? Maybe, but I have no idea how to do that. Yuan and Slotnick suggest directly stimulating the olfactory regions of the brain, but this is pretty invasive, and there are probably already better treatments for the small minority of patients who are going to let you directly stimulate brain regions. Maybe before we worry about this problem, we should investigate the more general question of sensory enhancement for depression. What would happen if you made people wear glasses that enhanced the color saturation of everything they saw? }
 \htmlp{Finally, what about just exposing depressed people to really strong smells? You will be excited to know that real scientists have studied} this ridiculous idea, and it seems promising, at least in extremely sketchy experiments on mice ( \htmla{https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.bbr.2011.12.040}{1},  \htmla{https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595338/}{2},  \htmla{https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16780969/}{3}). I have never seen any studies done on humans  \htmli{unless} this is actually how “aromatherapy” works, which would be hilarious. Aromatherapy seems to get positive results for depression with the same kind of bad studies that let all quackery generate positive results for everything. I can’t say more than that and I’m pretty skeptical here.}

 \htmlp{One way people have summed this up is that the media (and the experts they relied on) did a terrible job predicting what would happen. I think this lets them off too easy.}
 \htmlp{Prediction is very hard. Nate Silver is maybe the best political predicter alive, and he } \htmla{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/}{estimated a 29\% chance} of Trump winning just before Trump won. UPenn professor Philip Tetlock has spent decades identifying “superforecasters” and coming up with complicated algorithms for aggregating their predictions, developing  \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/04/book-review-superforecasting/}{a prediction infrastructure} that beats top CIA analysts, but they  \htmla{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-18/superforecasters-see-24-chance-of-brexit-as-economy-wins-out}{estimated a 23\% chance} Britain would choose Brexit just before it happened. This isn’t intended to criticize Silver or Tetlock. I believe they’re operating at close to optimum – the best anyone could possibly do with the information that they had. But the world is full of noise, and tiny chance events can have outsized effects, and there are only so many polls you can scrutinize, and even geniuses can only do so well.
 \htmlp{Predicting the coronavirus was equally hard, and the best institutions we had missed it. On February 20th, Tetlock’s superforecasters } \htmla{https://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/superforecaster-fridays-total-cases-coronavirus-reported-who-20-march-2020}{predicted only a 3\% chance} that there would be 200,000+ coronavirus cases a month later (there were). The stock market is a giant coordinated attempt to predict the economy, and it reached an all-time high on February 12, suggesting that analysts expected the economy to do great over the following few months. On February 20th it fell in a way that suggested a mild inconvenience to the economy, but it didn’t really start plummeting until mid-March – the same time the media finally got a clue. These aren’t empty suits on cable TV with no skin in the game. These are the best predictive institutions we have, and they got it wrong. I conclude that predicting the scale of coronavirus in mid-February – the time when we could have done something about it – was really hard.
 \htmlp{I don’t like this conclusion. But I have to ask myself – if it was so easy, why didn’t } \htmli{I} do it? It’s easy to look back and say “yeah, I always secretly knew it would be pretty bad”. I did a few things right – I started prepping half-heartedly in mid-February, I recommended my readers prep  \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-links-speculation-open-thread/}{in early March}, I never criticized others for being alarmist. Overall I give myself a solid B-. But if it was so easy, why didn’t I post “Hey everyone, I officially predict the coronavirus will be a nightmarish worldwide pandemic” two months ago? It wouldn’t have helped anything, but I would have had bragging rights forever. For that matter, why didn’t  \htmli{you} post this – on Facebook, on Twitter, on the comments here? You could have gone down in legend, alongside  \htmla{https://twitter.com/metaculus/status/1248966351508692992}{Travis W. Fisher}, for making a single tweet. Since you didn’t do that (aside from the handful of you who did – we love you, Balaji) I conclude that predicting it was hard, even for smart and well-intentioned people like yourselves.
 \htmlp{Does that mean we can’t put everyone’s heads on spikes outside the Capitol Building as a warning for future generations? I would be very disappointed if it meant that. I think we can still put heads on spikes. We just have to do it for more subtle, better-thought-out reasons.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{II.}
 \htmlp{I used to run user surveys for } \htmla{https://www.lesswrong.com/}{a forum on probabilistic reasoning}…
 \htmlp{(I promise this will become relevant soon)}
 \htmlp{A surprising number of these people had signed up for cryonics – the thing where they freeze your brain after you die, in case the future invents a way to resurrect frozen brains. Lots of people mocked us for this – “if you’re so good at probabilistic reasoning, how can you believe something so implausible?” I was curious about this myself, so I put some questions on one of the surveys.}
 \htmlp{The results were pretty strange. Frequent users of the forum (many of whom had pre-paid for brain freezing) said they estimated there was a 12\% chance the process would work and they’d get resurrected. A control group with no interest in cryonics estimated a 15\% chance. The people who were doing it were no more optimistic than the people who weren’t. What gives?}
 \htmlp{I think they were actually good at probabilistic reasoning. The control group said “15\%? That’s less than 50\%, which means cryonics probably won’t work, which means I shouldn’t sign up for it.” The frequent user group said “A 12\% chance of eternal life for the cost of a freezer? Sounds like a good deal!”}
 \htmlp{There are a lot of potential objections and complications – for one thing, maybe both those numbers are much too high. You can read more } \htmla{https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Gh2qQHrCg3teQen3c/rationalists-are-less-credulous-but-better-at-taking-ideas}{here} and  \htmla{https://www.gwern.net/Cryonics}{here}. But overall I learned something really important from this.
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/goofus.png}
 \htmlp{Making decisions is about more than just having certain beliefs. It’s also about how you act on them.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{III.}
 \htmlp{A few weeks ago, I wrote } \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/}{a blog post on face masks}. It reviewed the evidence and found that they probably helped prevent the spread of disease. Then it asked: how did the WHO, CDC, etc get this so wrong?
 \htmlp{I went into it thinking they’d lied to us, hoping to prevent hoarders from buying up so many masks that there weren’t enough for health workers. Turns out that’s not true. The CDC has been singing } \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/masks_cdc.png}{the same tune} for the past ten years. Swine flu, don’t wear masks. SARS, don’t wear masks. They’ve been really consistent on this point. But why?
 \htmlp{If you really want to understand what happened, don’t read any studies about face masks or pandemics. Read Smith & Pell (2003), } \htmla{https://www.bmj.com/content/327/7429/1459?ijkey=c3677213eca83ff6599127794fc58c4e0f6de55a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha}{Parachute Use To Prevent Death And Major Trauma Related To Gravitational Challenge: Systematic Review Of Randomized Controlled Trials}. It’s an article in the  \htmli{British Journal Of Medicine} pointing out that there have never been any good studies proving that parachutes are helpful when jumping out of a plane, so they fail to meet the normal standards of evidence-based medicine. From the Discussion section:
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{It is a truth universally acknowledged that a medical intervention justified by observational data must be in want of verification through a randomised controlled trial. Observational studies have been tainted by accusations of data dredging, confounding, and bias. For example, observational studies showed lower rates of ischaemic heart disease among women using hormone replacement therapy, and these data were interpreted as advocating hormone replacement for healthy women, women with established ischaemic heart disease, and women with risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. However, randomised controlled trials showed that hormone replacement therapy actually increased the risk of ischaemic heart disease, indicating that the apparent protective effects seen in observational studies were due to bias. Cases such as this one show that medical interventions based solely on observational data should be carefully scrutinised, and the parachute is no exception.}
 \htmlp{Of course this is a joke. It’s in the all-joke holiday edition of BMJ, and everyone involved knew exactly what they were doing. But the joke is funny because it points at something true. It’s biting social commentary. Doctors will not admit any treatment could possibly be good until it has a lot of randomized controlled trials behind it, common sense be damned. This didn’t come out of nowhere. They’ve been burned lots of times before by thinking they were applying common sense and getting things really wrong. And after your mistakes kill a few thousand people you start getting really paranoid and careful. And there are so many quacks who can spout off some “common sense” explanation for why their vitamin-infused bleach or colloidal silver should work that doctors have just become immune to that kind of bullshit. Multiple good RCTs or it didn’t happen. Given the history I think this is a defensible choice, and if you are tempted to condemn it you may find } \htmla{https://medium.com/@jamesheathers/hurry-dont-rush-e1aee626e733}{this story about bone marrow transplants} enlightening.
 \htmlp{But you can take this too far. After highlighting the lack of parachute RCTs, the paper continues:}
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{Only two options exist. The first is that we accept that, under exceptional circumstances, common sense might be applied when considering the potential risks and benefits of interventions. The second is that we continue our quest for the holy grail of exclusively evidence based interventions and preclude parachute use outside the context of a properly conducted trial. The dependency we have created in our population may make recruitment of the unenlightened masses to such a trial difficult. If so, we feel assured that those who advocate evidence based medicine and criticise use of interventions that lack an evidence base will not hesitate to demonstrate their commitment by volunteering for a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial.}
 \htmlp{Did you follow that? For a good parachute RCT, half the subjects would have to jump out of a plane wearing a placebo parachute. The authors suggest maybe we enlist doctors who insist too stringently on RCTs over common sense for this dubious honor.}
 \htmlp{(good news, though, a } \htmla{https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k5094}{parachute RCT did eventually get done})
 \htmlp{Sometimes good humor is a little too on the nose, like } \htmla{https://politics.theonion.com/bush-our-long-national-nightmare-of-peace-and-prosperi-1819565882}{those Onion articles} that come true a few years later. The real medical consensus on face masks came from pretty much the same process as the fake medical consensus on parachutes. Common sense said that they worked. But there weren’t many good RCTs. We couldn’t do more, because it would have been unethical to deliberately expose face-mask-less people to disease. In the end, all we had were some mediocre trials of slightly different things that we had to extrapolate out of range.
 \htmlp{Just like the legal term for “not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt” is “not guilty”, the medical term for “not proven to work in several gold-standard randomized controlled trials” is “it doesn’t work” (and don’t get me started on } \htmla{http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/08/doctor-there-ar.html}{“no evidence”}). So the CDC said masks didn’t work.
 \htmlp{Going back to our diagram:}
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/goofus.png}
 \htmlp{Goofus started with the position that masks, being a new idea, needed incontrovertible proof. When the few studies that appeared weren’t incontrovertible enough, he concluded that people shouldn’t wear masks.}
 \htmlp{Gallant would have recognized the uncertainty – based on the studies we can’t be 100\% sure masks definitely work for this particular condition – and done a cost-benefit analysis. Common sensically, it seems like masks probably } \htmli{should} work. The existing evidence for masks is highly suggestive, even if it’s not utter proof. Maybe 80\% chance they work, something like that? If you can buy an 80\% chance of stopping a deadly pandemic for the cost of having to wear some silly cloth over your face, probably that’s a good deal. Even though regular medicine has good reasons for being as conservative as it is, during a crisis you have to be able to think on your feet.
 \htmlp \htmlb{IV.}
 \htmlp{But getting back to the media:}
 \htmlp{Their main excuse is that they were just relaying expert opinion – the sort of things the WHO and CDC and top epidemiologists were saying. I believe them. People on Twitter howl and gnash their teeth at this, asking why the press didn’t fact-check or challenge those experts. But I’m not sure I want to institute a custom of journalists challenging experts. Journalist Johann Hari decided to take it upon himself to challenge psychiatric experts, and wrote a serious of terrible articles and a terrible book saying they were wrong about everything. I am a psychiatrist and I can tell you he is so wrong that it is physically painful to read his stuff (though of course I would say that…). Most journalists stick to assuming the experts know more about their subject of expertise than they do, and I think this is wise. The role of science journalists is to primarily to relay, explain, give context to the opinions of experts, not to try to out-medicine the doctors. So I think this is a good excuse.}
 \htmlp{But I would ask this of any journalist who pleads that they were just relaying and providing context for expert opinions: what was the experts’ percent confidence in their position?}
 \htmlp{I am so serious about this. What fact could possibly be more relevant? What context could it possibly be more important to give? I’m not saying you need to have put a number in your articles, maybe your readers don’t go for that. But were you working off of one? Did this question even occur to you?}
 \htmlp{Nate Silver said there was a 29\% chance Trump would win. Most people interpreted that as “Trump probably won’t win” and got shocked when he did. What was the percent attached to your “coronavirus probably won’t be a disaster” prediction? Was it also 29\%? 20\%? 10\%? Are you sure you want to go lower than 10\%? Wuhan was already under total lockdown, they didn’t even have space to bury all the bodies, and you’re saying that there was less than 10\% odds that it would be a problem anywhere else? I hear people say there’s a 12 – 15\% chance that future civilizations will resurrect your frozen brain, surely the risk of coronavirus was higher than that?}
 \htmlp{And if the risk was 10\%, shouldn’t that have been the headline. “TEN PERCENT CHANCE THAT THERE IS ABOUT TO BE A PANDEMIC THAT DEVASTATES THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, KILLS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, AND PREVENTS YOU FROM LEAVING YOUR HOUSE FOR MONTHS”? Isn’t that a better headline than } \htmla{https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-social-media-b56326b6-ab16-4c8a-bc86-e29b06e5ab2b.html}{Coronavirus panic sells as alarmist information spreads on social media}? But that’s the headline you could have written if your odds were ten percent!
 \htmlp{So:}
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/goofus.png}
 \htmlp{I think people acted like Goofus again.}
 \htmlp{People were presented with a new idea: a global pandemic might arise and change everything. They waited for proof. The proof didn’t arise, at least at first. I remember hearing people say things like “there’s no reason for panic, there are currently only ten cases in the US”. This should sound like “there’s no reason to panic, the asteroid heading for Earth is still several weeks away”. The only way I can make sense of it is through a mindset where you are not allowed to entertain an idea until you have proof of it. Nobody had incontrovertible evidence that coronavirus was going to be a disaster, so until someone does, you default to the null hypothesis that it won’t be.}
 \htmlp{Gallant wouldn’t have waited for proof. He would have checked prediction markets and asked top experts for probabilistic judgments. If he heard numbers like 10 or 20 percent, he would have done a cost-benefit analysis and found that putting some tough measures into place, like quarantine and social distancing, would be worthwhile if they had a 10 or 20 percent chance of averting catastrophe.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{V.}
 \htmlp{This is at risk of getting too depressing, so I want to focus on some people who deserve recognition for especially good responses.}
 \htmlp{First, a bunch of generic smart people on Twitter who got things exactly right – there are too many of these people to name, but } \htmla{https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695}{Scott Aaronson highlights} “Bill Gates, Balaji Srinivasan, Paul Graham, Greg Cochran, Robin Hanson, Sarah Constantin, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Nicholas Christakis.” None of these people (except Greg Cochran) are domain experts, and none of them (except Greg Cochran) have creepy oracular powers. So how could they have beaten the experts? Haven’t we been told a million times that generic intelligence is no match for deep domain knowledge?
 \htmlp{I think the answer is: they didn’t beat the experts in epidemiology. Whatever probability of pandemic the experts and prediction markets gave for coronavirus getting really bad, these people didn’t necessarily give a higher probability. They were just better at probabilistic reasoning, so they had different reactions to the same number. There’s no reason generic why smart people shouldn’t be better at probabilistic reasoning then epidemiologists. In fact, this seems exactly like the sort of thing generic smart people might be.}
 \htmlp{Zeynep Tufekci is an even clearer example. She’s a sociologist and journalist who } \htmla{https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/preparing-for-coronavirus-to-strike-the-u-s/}{was writing about} how it was “our civic duty” to prepare for coronavirus as early as February. She was also the first mainstream media figure to  \htmla{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html}{spread the word} that masks were probably helpful.
 \htmlp{Totally at random today, reading } \htmla{http://bactra.org/weblog/ebola-and-mongol-modernity.html}{a blog post on the Mongol Empire} like all normal people do during a crisis, I stumbled across a different reference to Zeynep. In a 2014 article, she was  \htmla{https://medium.com/message/ebola-the-real-reason-everyone-should-panic-889f32740e3e}{sounding a warning about the Ebola pandemic} that was going on at the time. She was saying the exact same things everyone is saying now – global institutions are failing, nobody understands exponential growth, travel restrictions could work early but won’t be enough if it breaks out. She quoted a CDC prediction that there could be a million cases by the end of 2014. “Let that sink in,” she wrote. “A million Ebola victims in just a few months.”
 \htmlp{In fact, this didn’t happen. There were only about 30,000 cases. The virus never really made it out of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.}
 \htmlp{I don’t count this as a failed prediction on Zeynep’s part. First of all, because it could have been precisely because of people like her sounding the alarm that the epidemic was successfully contained. But more important, it wasn’t really a prediction at all. Her point wasn’t that she definitely knew this Ebola pandemic was the one that would be really bad. Her point was that it might be, so we needed to prepare. She said the same thing when the coronavirus was just starting. If this were a game, her batting average would be 50\%, but that’s the wrong framework.}
 \htmlp{Zeynep Tufecki is admirable. But her admirable skill isn’t looking at various epidemics and successfully predicting which ones will be bad and which ones will fizzle out. She can’t do that any better than anyone else. Her superpower is her ability to treat something as important even before she has incontrovertible evidence that it has to be.}
 \htmlp{And finally, Kelsey Piper. She wrote a February 6th } \htmla{https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/6/21121303/coronavirus-wuhan-panic-pandemic-outbreak}{article} saying:
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{The coronavirus killed fewer people than the flu did in January. But it might kill more in February — and unlike the flu, its scope and effects are poorly understood and hard to guess at. The Chinese National Health Commission reports 24,324 cases, including 3,887 new ones today. There are some indications that these numbers understate the situation, as overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan only have the resources to test the most severe cases. As of Tuesday, 171,329 people are under medical observation because they’ve had close contact with a confirmed case.}
 \htmlp{It is unclear whether China will be able to get the outbreak under control or whether it will cause a series of epidemics throughout the country. It’s also unclear whether other countries — especially those with weak health systems — will be able to quickly identify any cases in their country and avoid Wuhan-scale outbreaks.}
 \htmlp{The point is, it’s simply too soon to assert we’ll do well on both those fronts — and if we fail, then the coronavirus death toll could well climb up into the tens of thousands. It also remains to be seen if vaccines or effective antiviral treatments will be developed. That’s just far too much uncertainty to assure people that they have nothing to worry about. And misleadingly assuring people that there’s nothing to worry about can end up doing harm.}
 \htmlp{“Instead of deriding people’s fears about the Wuhan coronavirus,” Sandman, the communications expert, writes, “I would advise officials and reporters to focus more on the high likelihood that things will get worse and the not-so-small possibility that they will get much worse.”}
 \htmlp{She concluded that “the Wuhan coronavirus likely won’t be a nightmare pandemic, but that scenario is still in play”, and followed it up with } \htmla{https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/28/21156128/coronavirus-prepare-outbreak-covid19-health}{an article} urging people to prepare by buying essential food and supplies.
 \htmlp{If we interpret her “likely won’t be a nightmare pandemic” sentence as a prediction, she got the prediction wrong. Like Zeynep, she has no special ability to predict whether any given disease will end in global disaster. But that didn’t matter! She gave exactly the correct advice to institutions (prepare for a worst-case scenario, stop telling people not to panic) and exactly the correct advice to individuals (start prepping). When you’re good enough at handling uncertainty, getting your predictions exactly right becomes almost superfluous.}
 \htmlp{The Vox article says the media needs to “say what it doesn’t know”. I agree with this up to a point. But they can’t let this turn into a muddled message of “oh, who knows anything, whatever”. Uncertainty about the world doesn’t imply uncertainty about the best course of action! Within the range of uncertainty that we had about the coronavirus this February, an article that acknowledged that uncertainty wouldn’t have looked like “We’re not sure how this will develop, so we don’t know whether you should stop large gatherings or not”. It would have looked like “We’re not sure how this will develop, so you should } \htmli{definitely} stop large gatherings.” 
 \htmlp{I worry that the people who refused to worry about coronavirus until too late thought they were “being careful” and “avoiding overconfidence”. And I worry the lesson they’ll take away from this is to be more careful, and avoid overconfidence even more strongly. }
 \htmlp{Experts should think along these lines when making their recommendations, but if they don’t, the press should think along them as part of its work of putting expert recommendations in context. I think Kelsey’s article provides an shining example of what this should look like.}
 \htmlp{Maybe other people got this right too. I’m singling out Kelsey because of a personal connection – I met her through the same probabilistic reasoning forum where I did my cryonics survey years ago. I don’t think this is a coincidence.}

He explains that because bats expend so much energy flying, they run higher body temperatures than other mammals, which degrades their DNA. Their DNA is such a mess that the usual immune system strategy of targeting suspicious DNA doesn’t work, so they accept constant low-grade infection with a bunch of viruses as a cost of doing business. Sometimes those viruses cross to humans, and then we get another bat-borne disease.

But I’m not sure how much to hold it against them. Looking at their webpage, it mostly investigates whether a country has good plans addressing various issues of a crisis, and lots of resources that it can deploy if needed. As best I can tell, the US had great plans and didn’t follow any of them, and lots of resources which it totally failed to deploy effectively. Responsible think tanks are probably not allowed to add a -10000 points at the end of their analysis for “but its leaders are idiots”.

 \htmlp{Some socialists on social media are trying to spread a narrative where capitalists think the economy is more important than lives and want to lift the lockdown immediately, and it’s only socialists who are standing up for the importance of saving people. Top economists aren’t a perfect stand-in for capitalists, but it’s still pretty clear that they’re wrong.}
 \htmlp{Also, there are starting to be some econ papers trying to more rigorously analyze the pros and cons of lockdown. } \htmla{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3561934}{The Benefits and Costs of Flattening the Curve for COVID-19} says that “assuming that social distancing measures can substantially reduce contacts among individuals, we find net benefits of roughly \$5 trillion in our benchmark scenario”.
 \htmlp \htmlb{USA! USA!}
 \htmlp{Is there anything Americans can be proud of here?}
 \htmlp \htmla{https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1240348644554887168}{@noahpinion reminds us} of America’s long history of being late on the trigger but doing a great job once we get started (Churchill: “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.”). We were late entrants into both World Wars but had an outsized effect on both of them. In that spirit, although we were very slow to start testing, we’ve ramped up impressively fast – from almost none to 1/3 of South Korean levels per capita within a few weeks. 
 \htmlp{Also worth celebrating – during the Wuhan phase of the pandemic, China } \htmla{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-hospital.html}{built an impromptu 1,000 patient hospital in ten days}. US media reported this as unbelievable – a sign that a young and vigorous country could accomplish feats that a decadent America could never dream of. But last week in New York, the Army Corps of Engineers converted the Javits Convention Center into an impromptu 2,000 patient hospital in… \htmla{https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2133514/corps-of-engineers-converts-nycs-javits-center-into-hospital/}{about ten days}. 
 \htmlp{I don’t know, maybe this was easier because they’re converting an existing structure instead of building a whole new one (though even the Chinese used prefab units). But it’s nice to know we still have it in us to do things quickly. There’s no civilizational decline. If the government ever legalized building things quickly again, we’d be mopping the floor with China within weeks.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{Legal Immunity}
 \htmlp{There’s a Jewish legal principle called } \htmla{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marit_ayin} \htmli{marit ayin}, which means that it’s illegal to do something which is legal but looks illegal. For example, you can’t eat some kind of plant-based Impossible Bacon, because it would look like you were eating real bacon. Some authorities say it is sometimes permissible to eat the Impossible Bacon if you leave the box out in a prominent position so that it doesn’t look illegal; I’m not sure of the details.
 \htmlp{The argument is that widespread flagrant unpunished violation of the law makes the law uncompelling and unenforceable, and this is true whether the violation is real or imagined. If you never see anyone eat bacon, you probably won’t eat it yourself; if everyone around you seems to be eating bacon all the time, it feels less taboo. Also, if you’re a police officer, it’s hard to identify the real bacon eaters if there are a bunch of people eating Impossible Bacon who get annoyed every time you question them.}
 \htmlp{I was thinking about this recently with the news that Germany is considering issuing } \htmla{https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-germany-covid-19-immunity-certificates-testing-social-distancing-lockdown-2020-3}{immunity certificates} for people who have gotten coronavirus, recovered, and are now safe to do normal activities. It’s a good idea, but suffers from the same problem as Impossible Bacon – if there are hundreds of people going outside maskless, eating at restaurants, and sunning themselves on the beach, it’s going to be hard for the rest of us to take lockdown seriously enough.
 \htmlp{The equivalent of the rabbis’ put-the-box-out solution would be for governments to issue not just a certificate but some kind of unique article of clothing people could wear to mark their status. For example, they might give an unusually shaped red cap – if the beaches are full of people in red caps, that’s fine and doesn’t say anything about whether you personally should go sunbathe. And if the beachgoers see someone without a red cap, they can question them or keep their distance.}
 \htmlp{This would take a lot of centralized coordination, though. I’m not sure how you could send the same message without a government order explaining what the cap meant to everybody. Though (as per } \htmla{https://www.theonion.com/we-have-coronavirus-under-control-announces-cdc-dire-1842128516}{this Onion article}) wearing a fake pangolin snout over your nose would send a strong signal.

 \htmlp{I almost screwed up yesterday’s journal club. The study reported an odds ratio of 2.9 for antidepressants. Even though I } \htmli{knew}  \htmla{http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004767.html}{odds ratios are terrible} and you should never trust your intuitive impression of them, I  \htmli{still} mentally filed this away as “sounds like a really big effect”.
 \htmlp{This time I was saved by Chen’s } \htmla{https://sci-hub.tw/10.1080/03610911003650383}{How Big is a Big Odds Ratio? Interpreting the Magnitudes of Odds Ratios in Epidemiological Studies}, which explains how to convert ORs into effect sizes. Colored highlights are mine. I have followed the usual statistical practice of interpreting effect sizes of 0.2 as “small”, of 0.5 as “moderate”, and 0.8 as “large”, but feeling guilty about it.
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/chentable.png}
 \htmlp{Based on } \htmla{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/352586/convert-odds-ratio-to-cohens-d-taking-rate-of-prevalence-into-account}{this page}, I gather Chen has used some unusually precise formula to calculate this, but that a quick heuristic is to ignore the prevalence and just take [ln(odds ratio)]/1.81. 
 \htmlp{Suppose you run a drug trial. In your control group of 1000 patients, 300 get better on their own. In your experimental group of 1000 patients, 600 get better total (presumably 300 on their own, 300 because your drug worked). The } \htmla{https://www.medcalc.org/calc/relative_risk.php}{relative risk calculator} says your relative risk of recovery on the drug is 2.0.  \htmla{https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/the-difference-between-relative-risk-and-odds-ratios/}{Odds ratio} is 3.5, effect size is 0.7. So you’ve managed to double the recovery rate – in fact, to save an entire extra 30\% of your population – and you  \htmli{still} haven’t qualified for a “large” effect size.
 \htmlp{The moral of the story is that (to me) odds ratios sound bigger than they really are, and effect sizes sound smaller, so you should be really careful comparing two studies that report their results differently.}}

 \htmlp{We already had } \htmla{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANDAS}{PANDAS} (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus) and  \htmla{https://panda.gsi.de/}{PANDA} (Proton ANnhilator At DArmstadt). But the latest in this pandemic of panda pandering is the  \htmla{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30366-9/fulltext#figures}{PANDA} (Prescribing ANtiDepressants Appropriately) Study. A group of British scientists followed 655 complicated patients who received either placebo or the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft®).
 \htmlp{The PANDA trial was unique in two ways. First, as mentioned, it was the largest ever trial for a single antidepressant not funded by a pharmaceutical company. Second, it was designed to mimic “the real world” as closely as possible. In most antidepressant trials, researchers wait to gather the perfect patients: people who definitely have depression and definitely don’t have anything else. Then they get top psychiatrists to carefully evaluate each patient, monitor the way they take the medication, and exhaustively test every aspect of their progress with complicated questionnaires. PANDA looked for normal people going to their GP’s (US English: PCP’s) office, with all of the mishmash of problems and comorbidities that implies.}
 \htmlp{Measuring real-world efficacy is especially important for antidepressant research because past studies have failed to match up with common sense. Most studies show antidepressants having “clinically insignificant” effects on depression; that is, although scientists can find a statistical difference between treatment and placebo groups, it seems too small to matter. But in the real world, most doctors find antidepressants very useful, and many patients credit them for impressive recoveries. Maybe a big real-world study would help bridge the gap between study vs. real-world results.}
 \htmlp{The study used an interesting selection criteria – you were allowed in if you and your doctor reported “uncertainty…about the possible benefit of an antidepressant”. That is, people who definitely didn’t need antidepressants were sent home without an antidepressant, people who definitely } \htmli{did} need antidepressants got the antidepressant, and people on the borderline made it into the study. This is very different from the usual pharma company method of using the people who desperately need antidepressants the most in order to inflate success rates. And it’s more relevant to clinical practice – part of what it means for studies to guide our clinical practice is to tell us what to do in cases where we’re otherwise not sure. And unlike most studies, which use strict diagnostic criteria, this study just used a perception of needing help – not even necessarily for depression, some of these patients were anxious or had other issues. Again, more relevant for clinical practice, where the borders between depression, anxiety, etc aren’t always that clear.
 \htmlp{They ended up with 655 people, ages 18-74, from Bristol, Liverpool, London, and York. They followed up on how they were doing at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after they started medication. As usual, they scored patients on a bunch of different psychiatric tests.}
 \htmlp{In the end, PANDA confirmed what we already know: it is really hard to measure antidepressant outcomes, and all the endpoints conflict with each other.}
 \htmlp{I am going to be } \htmli{much} nicer to you than the authors of the original paper were to their readers, and give you a convenient table with all of the results converted to effect sizes. All values are positive, meaning the antidepressant group beat the placebo group. I calculated some of this by hand, so it may be wrong.

 \htmlp{PHQ-9 is a common depression test. BDI is another common depression test. GAD-7 is an anxiety test. SF-12 is a vague test of how mentally healthy you’re feeling. Remission indicates percent of patients whose test scores have improved enough that they qualify as “no longer depressed”. General improvement was just asking patients if they felt any better.}
 \htmlp{I like this study because it examines some of the mystery of why antidepressants do much worse in clinical trials than according to anecdotal doctor and patient intuitions. One possibility has always been that we’re measuring these things wrong. This study goes to exactly the kind of naturalistic setting where people report good results, and measures things a bunch of different ways to see what happens.}
 \htmlp{The results are broadly consistent with previous studies. Usually people think of effect sizes less than 0.2 as miniscule, less than 0.5 as small, and less than 0.8 as medium. This study showed only small to low-medium effect sizes for everything.}
 \htmlp{I haven’t checked whether differences between effect sizes were significant. But just eyeballing them, this study doesn’t agree with my hypothesis that SSRIs are better for anxiety than for depression; the GAD-7 effect size is about the same as the PHQ and BDI effect sizes.}
 \htmlp{It does weakly support a hypothesis where SSRIs are better for patient-rated improvement than for researcher-measured tests. The highest effect size was in “self-rated improvement”, where the researchers just asked the patients if they felt better. This effect size (0.49) was still small. But if we let ourselves round it up, it reaches all the way to “medium”. Progress!}
 \htmlp{What does this mean in real life? 59\% of patients in the antidepressant group, compared to 42\% of patients in the placebo group, said they felt better. I’m actually okay with this. It means that for every 58 patients who wouldn’t have gotten better on placebo, 17 of them would get better on an antidepressant – in other words, the antidepressant successfully converted 30\% of people from nonresponder to responder. This obviously isn’t as good as 50\% or 100\%. But it doesn’t strike me as consistent with the claims of “clinically insignificant” and “why would anyone ever use these medications”?}
 \htmlp{(though of course, this is just one study, and it’s a study where I took the most promising of many different endpoints, so it’s not exactly cause for celebration)}
 \htmlp{If antidepressants do better on patient report than on our depression tests, does that mean our depression tests are bad? Maybe. Figure 4 from } \htmla{https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/s2215-0366(19)30216-0}{Hieronymous et al} helps clarify a bit of what’s going on:
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/hieronymous.png}
 \htmlp{At least in less severely depressed patients, antidepressants are more likely to produce significant gains on vaguer or more fundamental symptoms (like “depressed mood” or “anxiety”) than on specific symptoms (like insomnia or psychomotor disruptions). Probably patients care a lot less about “psychomotor disruptions” than researchers studying depression do, and they just want to feel happy again. This study’s finding of an 0.4 – 0.5 effect size on patient response closely matches Hieronymous et al’s finding of an 0.4 – 0.5 effect size on depressed mood.}
 \htmlp{Like most studies, PANDA used a one-size-fits-all solution based on a single antidepressant. This is a reasonable choice for a study, but doesn’t match clinical practice, where we usually try one antidepressant, see if it works, and try another if it doesn’t. In patients like the ones in the study, who had failed treatment with sertraline, a usual next step would be to try bupropion. An even better idea would be to screen patients for more typical vs. atypical depression, start people on sertraline or bupropion based on the symptom profile, and then switch to the other if the first one didn’t work. The STAR*D trial did something like this, and got better results than an SSRI alone. I haven’t done the work I would need to compare this to STAR*D, but it seems possible that the extra push from targeted treatment could bring our 0.49 effect size up to the 0.7 or 0.8 level where we could actually feel fully confident prescribing this stuff.}}

The Oracle of Delphi told Croesus he would destroy a great empire, but when he rode out to battle, the empire he destroyed was his own. Zechariah predicted the Israelites would rebel against God; they did so by killing His prophet Zechariah.

You can guess what happened next. His book came out March 3, 2020, in the middle of a global pandemic and economic collapse. He couldn’t go on tour to promote it, on account of the pandemic. Nobody was buying books anyway, on account of the economic collapse. All the newspapers and journals and so on that would usually cover an exciting new book were busy covering the pandemic and economic collapse instead. The score is still gods one zillion, prophets zero. So Ord’s PR person asked me to help spread the word, and here we are.
 \htmlp{Imagine you were sent back in time to inhabit the body of Adam, primordial ancestor of mankind. It turns out the Garden of Eden has motorcycles, and Eve challenges you to a race. You know motorcycles can be dangerous, but you’re an adrenaline junkie, naturally unafraid of death. And it would help take your mind off that ever-so-tempting Tree of Knowledge. Do you go?}
 \htmlp{Before you do, consider that you’re not just risking your own life. A fatal injury to either of you would snuff out the entire future of humanity. Every song ever composed, every picture ever painted, every book ever written by all the greatest authors of the millennia would die stillborn. Millions of people would never meet their true loves, or get to raise their children. All of the triumphs and tragedies of humanity, from the conquests of Alexander to the moon landings, would come to nothing if you hit a rock and cracked your skull.}
 \htmlp{So maybe you shouldn’t motorcycle race. Maybe you shouldn’t even go outside. Maybe you and Eve should hide, panicked, in the safest-looking cave you can find.}
 \htmlp{Ord argues that 21st century humanity is in much the same situation as Adam. The potential future of the human race is vast. We have another five billion years until the sun goes out, and 10^100 until the universe becomes uninhabitable. Even with conservative assumptions, the galaxy could support quintillions of humans. Between Eden and today, the population would have multiplied five billion times; between today and our galactic future, it could easily multiply another five billion. However awed Adam and Eve would have been when they considered the sheer size of the future that depended on them, we should be equally awed.}
 \htmlp{So maybe we should do the equivalent of not motorcycling. And that would mean taking existential risks (“x-risks”) – disasters that might completely destroy humanity or permanently ruin its potential – very seriously. Even more seriously than we would take them just based on the fact that we don’t want to die. Maybe we should consider all counterbalancing considerations – “sure, global warming might be bad, but we also need to keep the economy strong!” – to be overwhelmed by the crushing weight of the future.}
 \htmlp{This is my metaphor, not Ord’s. He uses a different one – the Cuban Missile Crisis. We all remember the Cuban Missile Crisis as a week where humanity teetered on the precipice of destruction, then recovered into a more stable not-immediately-going-to-destroy-itself state. Ord speculates that far-future historians will remember the entire 1900s and 2000s as a sort of centuries-long Cuban Missile Crisis, a crunch time when the world was unusually vulnerable and everyone had to take exactly the right actions to make it through.

 \htmlp{Ord has other metaphors too, and other arguments. The first sixty pages of } \htmli{Precipice} are a series of arguments and thought experiments intended to drive home the idea that everyone dying would be really bad. Some of them were new to me and quite interesting – for example, an argument that we should keep the Earth safe for future generations as a way of “paying it forward” to our ancestors, who kept it safe for us. At times, all these arguments against allowing the destruction of the human race felt kind of excessive – isn’t there widespread agreement on this point? Even when there is disagreement, Ord doesn’t address it here, banishing counterarguments to various appendices – one arguing against time discounting the value of the future, another arguing against ethical theories that deem future lives irrelevant. This part of the book isn’t trying to get into the intellectual weeds. It’s just saying, again and again, that it would be  \htmli{really bad} if we all died.
 \htmlp{It’s tempting to psychoanalyze Ord here, with help from passages like this one:}
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{I have not always been focused on protecting our longterm future, coming to the topic only reluctantly. I am a philosopher at Oxford University, specialising in ethics. My earlier work was rooted in the more tangible concerns of global health and global poverty – in how we could best help the worst off. When coming to grips with these issues I felt the need to take my work in ethics beyond the ivory tower. I began advising the World Health Organization, World Bank, and UK government on the ethics of global health. And finding that my own money could do hundreds of times as much good for those in poverty as it could do for me, I made a lifelong pledge to donate at least a tenth of all I earn to help them. I founded a society, Giving What We Can, for those who wanted to join me, and was heartened to see thousands of people come together to pledge more than one billion pounds over our lifetimes to the most effective charities we know of, working on the most important causes. Together, we’ve already been able to transform the lives of thousands of people. And because there are many other ways beyond our donations in which we can help fashion a better world, I helped start a wider movement, known as “effective altruism”, in which people aspire to use prudence and reason to do as much good as possible.}
 \htmlp{We’re in the Garden of Eden, so we should stop worrying about motorcycling and start worrying about protecting our future. But Ord’s equivalent of “motorcycling” was advising governments and NGOs on how best to fight global poverty. I’m familiar with his past work in this area, and he was amazing at it. He stopped because he decided that protecting the long-term future was more important. What must he think of the rest of us, who aren’t stopping our ordinary, non-saving-thousands-of-people-from-poverty day jobs?}
 \htmlp{In writing about Ord’s colleagues in the } \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/}{effective altruist movement}, I quoted Larissa MacFarquahar on Derek Parfit:
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{When I was interviewing him for the first time, for instance, we were in the middle of a conversation and suddenly he burst into tears. It was completely unexpected, because we were not talking about anything emotional or personal, as I would define those things. I was quite startled, and as he cried I sat there rewinding our conversation in my head, trying to figure out what had upset him. Later, I asked him about it. It turned out that what had made him cry was the idea of suffering. We had been talking about suffering in the abstract. I found that very striking.}
 \htmlp{Toby Ord was Derek Parfit’s grad student, and I get sort of the same vibe from him – someone whose reason and emotions are unusually closely aligned. Stalin’s maxim that “one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic” accurately describes how most of us think. I am not sure it describes Toby Ord. I can’t say confidently that Toby Ord feels } \htmli{exactly} a million times more intense emotions when he considers a million deaths than when he considers one death, but the scaling factor is definitely up there. When he considers ten billion deaths, or the deaths of the trillions of people who might inhabit our galactic future, he – well, he’s reduced to writing sixty pages of arguments and metaphors trying to cram into our heads exactly how bad this would be.
 \htmlp \htmlb{II.}
 \htmlp{The second part of the book is an analysis of specific risks, how concerned we should be about each, and what we can do to prevent them. Ord stays focused on } \htmli{existential} risks here. He is not very interested in an asteroid that will wipe out half of earth’s population; the other half of humanity will survive to realize our potential. He’s not  \htmli{completely} uninterested – wiping out half of earth’s population could cause some chaos that makes it harder to prepare for other catastrophes. But his main focus is on things that would kill everybody – or at least leave too few survivors to effectively repopulate the planet.
 \htmlp{I expected Ord to be alarmist here. He is writing a book about existential risks, whose thesis is that we should take them extremely seriously. Any other human being alive would use this as an opportunity to play up how dangerous these risks are. Ord is too virtuous. Again and again, he knocks down bad arguments for worrying too much, points out that killing every single human being on earth, including the ones in Antarctic research stations, is actually quite hard, and ends up convincing me to downgrade my risk estimate.}
 \htmlp{So for example, we can rule out a high risk of destruction by any natural disaster – asteroid, supervolcano, etc – simply because these things haven’t happened before in our species’ 100,000 year-odd history. Dino-killer sized asteroids seem to strike the Earth about once every few hundred million years, bounding the risk per century around the one-in-a-million level. But also, scientists are tracking almost all the large asteroids in the solar system, and when you account for their trajectories, the chance that one slips through and hits us in the next century goes down to less than one in a hundred fifty million. Large supervolcanoes seem to go off about once every 80,000 years, so the risk per century is 1/800. There are similar arguments around nearby supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and a bunch of other things.}
 \htmlp{I usually give any statistics I read a large penalty for “or maybe you’re a moron”. For example, lots of smart people said in 2016 that the chance of Trump winning was only 1\%, or 0.1\%, or 0.00001\%, or whatever. But also, they were morons. They were using models, and their models were egregiously wrong. If you hear a person say that their model’s estimate of something is 0.00001\%, very likely } \htmli{your} estimate of the thing should be much higher than that, because maybe they’re a moron. I explain this in more detail  \htmla{https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GrtbTAPfkJa4D6jjH/confidence-levels-inside-and-outside-an-argument}{here}.
 \htmlp{Ord is one of a tiny handful of people who doesn’t need this penalty. He explains this entire dynamic to his readers, agrees it is important, and adjusts several of his models appropriately. He is always careful to add a term for unknown unknowns – sometimes he is able to use clever methods to bound this term, other times he just takes his best guess. And he tries to use empirically-based methods that don’t have this problem, list his assumptions explicitly, and justify each assumption, so that you rarely have to rely on arguments shakier than “asteroids will continue to hit our planet at the same rate they did in the past”. I am really impressed with the care he puts into every argument in the book, and happy to accept his statistics at face value. People with no interest in x-risk may enjoy reading this book purely as an example of statistical reasoning done with beautiful lucidity.}
 \htmlp{When you accept very low numbers at face value, it can have strange implications. For example, should we study how to deflect asteroids? Ord isn’t sure. The base rate of asteroid strikes is so low that it’s outweighed by almost any change in the base rate. If we successfully learn how to deflect asteroids, that not only lets good guys deflect asteroids away from Earth, but also lets bad guys deflect asteroids } \htmli{towards} Earth. The chance that an dino-killer asteroid approaches Earth and needs to be deflected away is 1/150 million per century, with small error bars. The chance that malicious actors deflect an asteroid towards Earth is much harder to figure out, but it has wide error bars, and there are a  \htmli{lot} of numbers higher than 1/150 million. So probably most of our worry about asteroids over the next century should involve somebody using one as a weapon, and studying asteroid deflection probably makes that worse and not better.
 \htmlp{Ord uses similar arguments again and again. Humanity has survived 100,000 years, so its chance of death by natural disaster per century is probably less than 1 / 1,000 (for complicated statistical reasons, he puts it at between 1/10,000 and 1/100,000). But humanity has only had technology (eg nuclear weapons, genetically engineered bioweapons) for a few decades, so there are no such guarantees of its safety. Ord thinks the overwhelming majority of existential risk comes from this source, and singles out four particular technological risks as most concerning.}
 \htmlp \htmlu{First}, nuclear war. This was one of the places where Ord’s work is cause for optimism. You’ve probably heard that there are enough nuclear weapons to “destroy the world ten times over” or something like that. There aren’t. There are enough nuclear weapons to destroy lots of majors city, kill the majority of people, and cause a very bad nuclear winter for the rest. But there aren’t enough to literally kill every single human being. And because of the way the Earth’s climate works, the negative effects of nuclear winter would probably be concentrated in temperate and inland regions. Tropical islands and a few other distant locales (Ord suggests Australia and New Zealand) would have a good chance of making it through even a large nuclear apocalypse with enough survivors to repopulate the Earth. A lot of things would have to go wrong at once, and a lot of models be flawed in ways they don’t seem to be flawed, for a nuclear war to literally kill everyone. Ord gives the per-century risk of extinction from this cause at 1 in 1,000.
 \htmlp \htmlu{Second}, global warming. The  \htmla{https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk}{current scientific consensus} is that global warming will be really bad but not literally kill every single human. Even for implausibly high amounts of global warming, survivors can always flee to a pleasantly balmy Greenland. The main concern from an x-risk point of view is “runaway global warming” based on strong feedback loops. For example, global warming causes permafrost to melt, which releases previously trapped carbon, causing more global warming, causing more permafrost to melt, etc. Or global warming causes the oceans to warm, which makes them release more methane, which causes more global warming, causing the oceans to get warmer, etc. In theory, this could get really bad – something similar seems to have happened on Venus, which now has an average temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit. But Ord thinks it probably won’t happen here. His worst-case scenario estimates 13 – 20 degrees C of warming by 2300. This is really bad – summer temperatures in San Francisco would occasionally pass 140F – but still well short of Venus, and compatible with the move-to-Greenland scenario. Also, global temperatures jumped 5 degree C (to 14 degrees above current levels) fifty million years ago, and this didn’t seem to cause Venus-style runaway warming. This isn’t a perfect analogy for the current situation, since the current temperature increase is happening faster than the ancient one did, but it’s still a reason for hope. This is another one that could easily be an apocalyptic tragedy unparalleled in human history but probably not an existential risk; Ord estimates the x-risk per century as 1/1,000.
 \htmlp{The same is true for other environmental disasters, of which Ord discusses a long list. Overpopulation? No, fertility rates have crashed and the population is barely expanding anymore (also, it’s hard for overpopulation to cause human extinction). Resource depletion? New discovery seems to be faster than depletion for now, and society could route around most plausible resources shortages. Honeybee collapse? Despite what you’ve heard, losing all pollinators would only cause a 3 – 8\% decrease in global crop production. He gives all of these combined plus environmental unknown unknowns an additional 1/1,000, just in case.}
 \htmlp \htmlu{Third}, pandemics. Even though pathogens are natural, Ord classifies pandemics as technological disasters for two reasons. First, natural pandemics are probably getting worse because our technology is making cities denser, linking countries closer together, and bringing humans into more contact with the animal vectors of zoonotic disease (in one of the book’s more prophetic passages, Ord mentions the risk of a disease crossing from bats to humans). But second, bioengineered pandemics may be especially bad. These could be either accidental (surprisingly many biologists alter diseases to make them worse as part of apparently legitimate scientific research) or deliberate (bioweapons). There are enough unknown unknowns here that Ord is uncomfortable assigning relatively precise and low risk levels like he did in earlier categories, and this section generally feels kind of rushed, but he estimates the per-century x-risk from natural pandemics as 1/10,000 and from engineered pandemics as 1/30. 
 \htmlp{The } \htmlu{fourth} major technological risk is AI. You’ve all  \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/30/book-review-human-compatible/}{read about}  \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/27/book-review-reframing-superintelligence/}{this one} by now, so I won’t go into the details, but it fits the profile of a genuinely dangerous risk. It’s related to technological advance, so our long and illustrious history of not dying from it thus far offers no consolation. And because it could be actively trying to eliminate humanity, isolated populations on islands or in Antarctica or wherever offer less consolation than usual. Using the same arguments and  \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/08/ssc-journal-club-ai-timelines/}{sources} we’ve seen every other time this topic gets brought up, Ord assigns this a 1/10 risk per century, the highest of any of the scenarios he examines, writing:
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{In my view, the greatest risk to humanity’s potential in the next hundred years comes from unaligned artificial intelligence, which I put at 1 in 10. One might be surprised to see such a high number for such a speculative risk, so it warrants some explanation.}
 \htmlp{A common approach to estimating the chance of an unprecedented event with earth-shaking consequences is to take a sceptical stance: to start with an extremely small probability and only raise it from there when a large amount of hard evidence is presented. But I disagree. Instead, I think that the right method is to start with a probability that reflects our overall impressions, then adjust this in light of the scientific evidence. When there is a lot of evidence, these approaches converge. But when there isn’t, the starting point can matter.}
 \htmlp{In the case of artificial intelligence, everyone agrees the evidence and arguments are far from watertight, but the question is where does this leave us? Very roughly, my approach is to start with the overall view of the expert community that there is something like a 1 in 2 chance that AI agents capable of outperforming humans in almost every task will be developed in the coming century. And conditional on that happening, we shouldn’t be shocked if these agents that outperform us across the board were to inherit our future.}
 \htmlp{The book also addresses a few more complicated situations. There are ways humankind could fail to realize its potential even without being destroyed. For example, if it got trapped in some kind of dystopia that it was impossible to escape. Or if it lost so many of its values that we no longer recognized it as human. Ord doesn’t have too much to say about these situations besides acknowledging that they would be bad and need further research. Or a series of disasters could each precipitate one another, or a minor disaster could leave people unprepared for a major disaster, or something along those lines.}
 \htmlp{Here, too, Ord is more optimistic than some other sources I have read. For example, some people say that if civilization ever collapses, it will never be able to rebuild, because we’ve already used up all easily-accessible sources of eg fossil fuels, and an infant civilization won’t be able to skip straight from waterwheels to nuclear. Ord is more sanguine:}
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{Even if civilization did collapse, it is likely that it could be re-established. As we have seen, civilization has already been independently established at least seven times by isolated peoples. While one might think resources depletion could make this harder, it is more likely that it has become substantially easier. Most dissasters short of human extinction would leave our domesticated animals and plants, as well as copious material resources in the ruins of our cities – it is much easier to re-forge iron from old railings than to smelt it from ore. Even expendable resources such as coal would be much easier to access, via abandoned reserves and mines, than they ever were in the eighteenth century. Moreover, evidence that civilisation is possible, and the tools and knowledge to help rebuild, would be scattered across the world.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{III.}
 \htmlp{Still, these risks are real, and humanity will under-respond to them for predictable reasons. }
 \htmlp{First, free-rider problems. If some people invest resources into fighting these risks and others don’t, both sets of people will benefit equally. So all else being equal everyone would prefer that someone else do it. We’ve already seen this play out with international treaties on climate change.}
 \htmlp{Second, scope insensitivity. A million deaths, a billion deaths, and complete destruction of humanity all sound like such unimaginable catastrophes that they’re hardly worth differentiating. But plausibly we should put 1000x more resources into preventing a billion deaths than a million, and some further very large scaling factor into preventing human extinction. People probably won’t think that way, which will further degrade our existential risk readiness.}
 \htmlp{Third, availability bias. Existential risks have never happened before. Even their weaker non-omnicidal counterparts have mostly faded into legend – the Black Death, the Tunguska Event. The current pandemic is a perfect example. Big pandemics happen once every few decades – the Spanish flu of 1918 and the Hong Kong Flu of 1968 are the most salient recent examples. Most countries put some effort into preparing for the next one. But the preparation wasn’t very impressive. After this year, I bet we’ll put impressive effort into preparing for respiratory pandemics the next decade or two, while continuing to ignore other risks like solar flares or megadroughts that are equally predictable. People feel weird putting a lot of energy into preparing for something that has never happened before, and their value of “never” is usually “in a generation or two”. Getting them to care about things that have } \htmli{literally} never happened before, like climate change, nuclear winter, or AI risk, is an even taller order.
 \htmlp{And even when people seem to care about distant risks, it can feel like a half-hearted effort. During a Berkeley meeting of the Manhattan Project, Edward Teller brought up the basic idea behind the hydrogen bomb. You would use a nuclear bomb to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction in some other substance, which would produce a bigger explosion than the nuke itself. The scientists got to work figuring out what substances could support such reactions, and found that they couldn’t rule out nitrogen-14. The air is 79\% nitrogen-14. If a nuclear bomb produced nitrogen-14 fusion, it would ignite the atmosphere and turn the Earth into a miniature sun, killing everyone. They hurriedly convened a task force to work on the problem, and it reported back that neither nitrogen-14 nor a second candidate isotope, lithium-7, could support a self-sustaining fusion reaction.}
 \htmlp{They seem to have been } \htmli{moderately} confident in these calculations. But there was enough uncertainty that, when the Trinity test produced a brighter fireball than expected, Manhattan Project administrator James Conant was “overcome with dread”, believing that atmospheric ignition had happened after all and the Earth had only seconds left. And later, the US detonated a bomb whose fuel was contaminated with lithium-7, the explosion was much bigger than expected, and some bystanders were killed. It turned out atomic bombs could initiate lithium-7 fusion after all! As Ord puts it, “of the two major thermonuclear calculations made that summer at Berkeley, they got one right and one wrong”. This doesn’t really seem like the kind of crazy anecdote you could tell in a civilization that was taking existential risk seriously enough.
 \htmlp{So what should we do? That depends who you mean by “we”.}
 \htmlp{Ordinary people should follow the standard advice of effective altruism. If they feel like their talents are suited for a career in this area, they should check out } \htmla{https://80000hours.org/}{80,000 Hours} and similar resources and try to pursue it. Relevant careers include science (developing helpful technologies to eg capture carbon or understand AI), politics and policy (helping push countries to take risk-minimizing actions), and general thinkers and influencers (philosophers to remind us of our ethical duties, journalists to help keep important issues fresh in people’s minds). But also, anything else that generally strengthens and stabilizes the world. Diplomats who help bring countries closer together, since international peace reduces the risk of nuclear war and bioweapons and makes cooperation against other threats more likely. Economists who help keep the market stable, since a prosperous country is more likely to have resources to devote to the future. Even teachers are helping train the next generation of people who can help in the effort, although Ord warns against going  \htmli{too} meta – most people willing to help with this will still be best off working on causes that affect existential risk directly. If they don’t feel like their talents lie in any of these areas, they can keep earning money at ordinary jobs and donate some of it (traditionally 10\%) to x-risk related charities.
 \htmlp{Rich people, charitable foundations, and governments should fund anti-x-risk work more than they’re already doing. Did you know that the Biological Weapons Convention, a key international agreement banning biological warfare, has a budget lower than the average McDonald’s restaurant (not total McDonald corporate profits, a single restaurant)? Or that total world spending on preventing x-risk is less than total world spending on ice cream? Ord suggests a target of between 0.1\% and 1\% of gross world product for anti-x-risk efforts. }
 \htmlp{And finally, Ord has a laundry list of requests for sympathetic policy-makers (Appendix F). Most of them are to put more research and funding into things, but the actionable specific ones are: restart various nuclear disarmament treaties, take ICBMs off “hair-trigger alert”, have the US rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, fund the Biological Weapons Convention better, and mandate that DNA synthesis companies screen consumer requests for dangerous sequences so that terrorists can’t order a batch of smallpox virus (80\% of companies currently do this screening, but 20\% don’t). The actual appendix is six pages long, there are a } \htmli{lot} of requests to put more research and funding into things.
 \htmlp{In the last section, Ord explains that all of this is just the first step. After we’ve conquered existential risk (and all our other problems), we’ll have another task: to contemplate how we want to guide the future. Before we spread out into the galaxy, we might want to take a few centuries to sit back and think about what our obligations are to each other, the universe, and the trillions of people who may one day exist. We cannot take infinite time for this; the universe is expanding, and for each year we spend not doing interstellar colonization, three galaxies cross the } \htmla{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon#Event_horizon}{cosmological event horizon} and become forever unreachable, and all the potential human civilizations that might have flourished there come to nothing. Ord expects us to be concerned about this, and tries to reassure us that it will be okay (the  \htmli{relative} loss each year is only one five-billionth of the universe). So he thinks taking a few centuries to reflect before beginning our interstellar colonization is worthwhile on net. But for now, he thinks this process should take a back seat to safeguarding the world from x-risk. Deal with the Cuban Missile Crisis we’re perpetually in the middle of, and  \htmli{then} we’ll have time for normal philosophy.
 \htmlp \htmlb{IV.}
 \htmlp{In the spirit of highly-uncertain-estimates } \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/}{being better than no estimates at all}, Ord offers this as a draft of where the existential risk community is right now (“they are not in any way the final word, but are a concise summary of all I know about the risk landscape”):
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/ord_table.png}
 \htmlp{Again, the most interesting thing for me is how low most of the numbers are. It’s a strange sight in a book whose thesis could be summarized as “we need to care more about existential risk”. I think most people paying attention will be } \htmli{delighted} to learn there’s a 5 in 6 chance the human race will survive until 2120.
 \htmlp{This is where I turn to my psychoanalysis of Toby Ord again. I think he, God help him, sees a number like that and } \htmli{responds appropriately}. He multiplies 1/6th by 10 billion deaths and gets 1.6 billion deaths. Then he multiplies 1/6th by the hundreds of trillions of people it will prevent from ever existing, and gets tens of trillions of people. Then he considers that the centuries just keep adding up, until by 2X00 the risk is arbitrarily high. At that point, the difference between a 1/6 chance of humanity dying per century vs. a 5/6 chance of humanity dying may have psychological impact. But the overall takeaway from both is “Holy @!#\$, we better put a lot of work into dealing with this.”
 \htmlp{There’s an old joke about a science lecture. The professor says that the sun will explode in five billion years, and sees a student visibly freaking out. She asks the student what’s so scary about the sun exploding in five billion years. The student sighs with relief: “Oh, thank God! I thought you’d said five } \htmli{million} years!”
 \htmlp{We can imagine the opposite joke. A professor says the sun will explode in five minutes, sees a student visibly freaking out, and repeats her claim. The student, visibly relieved: “Oh, thank God! I thought you’d said five } \htmli{seconds}.”
 \htmlp{When read carefully, } \htmli{The Precipice} is the book-length version of the second joke. Things may not be quite as disastrous as you expected. But relief may not quite be the appropriate emotion, and there’s still a lot of work to be done.}

So there’s some circumstantial evidence that these cloth masks might be helpful.  \htmla{http://akkie.mods.jp/2019-nCoV/images/c/c0/\%E3\%82\%B5\%E3\%83\%BC\%E3\%82\%B8\%E3\%82\%AB\%E3\%83\%AB\%E3\%83\%9E\%E3\%82\%B9\%E3\%82\%AF\%E5\%8C\%BB\%E7\%99\%82vs\%E5\%B8\%82\%E4\%B8\%AD\%E6\%84\%9F\%E6\%9F\%93\%E4\%BA\%88\%E9\%98\%B2\%EF\%BC\%9A\%E7\%B7\%8F\%E8\%AA\%AC_\%282015\%2C_MacIntyre\%29.pdf}{Most experts} in the early 2000s agreed that these masks were probably better than nothing. In 2015, an Australian team set out to prove it with a randomized controlled trial.
 \htmlp{They went to a hospital in Vietnam and randomized workers there to a normal mask group, a cloth mask group, or a control group. Because it would have been unethical to tell the control group not to wear masks, they left the control group alone. Most control group workers did end up wearing masks sometimes, but less than the experimental groups did.}
 \htmlp{After a month, they counted how many infections each group had, for three different categories of infection. Here are the results:}
 \htmlp \htmlcenter \htmlimg{https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/clothmask.png}
 \htmlp \htmlfont{1} \htmli{Technically significant only in the ILI category, but later the authors do various post hoc adjustment for confounders and find it’s significant everywhere}
 \htmlp{For all three categories, people wearing the real surgical masks were the healthiest, the control group was in the middle, and people wearing the cloth masks were the sickest.}
 \htmlp{This shows real surgical masks work better than cloth masks. It’s a little bit unclear about how well cloth masks work. They do worse than the control group, but you could tell two stories about that. In one, cloth masks are worse than no mask at all. In the other, cloth masks have zero-to-slight-positive efficacy, but because some people in the control group were wearing real surgical masks some of the time, they did better than the cloth group overall. So it depends a lot what the control group was doing.}
 \htmlp{Unfortunately, the paper doesn’t give us all the data we want. It tells us that about 57\% of both the surgical mask group and the cloth mask group wore masks regularly (defined as more than 70\% of the time) but only 24\% of the control group did. But there is no way of knowing whether the rest of the control group wore masks 69\% of the time or 0\% of the time.}
 \htmlp{A separate paragraph tells us that 37\% of the control group used surgical masks, 8\% cloth masks, and 53\% used a combination of both. These numbers don’t make a lot of sense in the context of the last paragraph, so I’m going to assume they meant that } \htmli{on the infrequent occasions they did wear masks}, those were the masks they used. But we don’t know if the compliant workers were disproportionately using cloth masks, disproportionately using medical masks, or both evenly. It’s hard to just eyeball these numbers and get a good sense for whether cloth masks really are worse than nothing.
 \htmlp{But the authors themselves lean towards the hypothesis that that cloth masks are actively bad. First, because after some calculations I cannot quite follow, they find that the difference between surgical masks and cloth masks is so high that either the surgical masks are absurdly good, or the difference is being augmented by the cloth masks being actively bad. But nobody has previously found surgical masks to be absurdly good. The authors cite two previous studies of theirs which } \htmli{did} include a no-mask control group; surgical masks did not significantly outperform nothing (they did show a trend towards doing so, and the studies were probably underpowered).
 \htmlp{Second, because they compare the numbers from this study to numbers from those other two studies directly. They find the rate of infection in surgical mask users is not-significantly-different throughout the three studies, and the rate of infection in surgical mask users and no-mask controls was also not-significantly-different, and therefore surgical masks are the same as nothing and so probably the cloth masks are actively bad.}
 \htmlp{I am very unimpressed by this. First, you are } \htmli{really} not supposed to compare things across multiple different studies. The authors protest that they did all three studies along pretty similar designs, but also admit they were different hospitals during different seasons. But second, almost no differences anywhere are significant, because all of these studies were at least a little underpowered. The current study found no significant difference between cloth masks and surgical masks in two of the three categories, even though the trend was in the expected direction. The other studies found no difference between wearing a medical mask and not wearing a medical mask, even though previous studies have suggested medical masks should work. They couldn’t even find any difference between wearing an N95 respirator and not wearing any protection at all. So when you need a chain of “x is not significantly different from y, which is not significantly different from z” in a bunch of studies that wouldn’t have been able to notice significant differences even if they existed, I stop believing it pretty quickly.
 \htmlp{(In fact, I think you could use the same logic to draw the exact opposite conclusion. The cloth mask group in the current study didn’t have a significant difference from the surgical mask group in the other study, and the surgical mask group was no different from placebo, therefore cloth masks cannot have a negative effect. I find it hard to believe the authors missed this, so let me know if I am confused here.)}
 \htmlp{But MacIntyre et al take it seriously, and conclude:}
 \htmlblockquote \htmlp{The study suggests medical masks may be protective, but the magnitude of difference raises the possibility that cloth masks cause an increase in infection risk in HCWs. Further, the filtration of the medical mask used in this trial was poor, making extremely high efficacy of medical masks unlikely, particularly given the predominant pathogen was rhinovirus, which spreads by the airborne route. Given the obligations to HCW occupational health and safety, it is important to consider the potential risk of using cloth masks […] The physical properties of a cloth mask, reuse, the frequency and effectiveness of cleaning, and increased moisture retention, may potentially increase the infection risk for health care workers. The virus may survive on the surface of the face-masks, and modelling studies have quantified the contamination levels of masks. Self-contamination through repeated use and improper doffing is possible. For example, a contaminated cloth mask may transfer pathogen from the mask to the bare hands of the wearer. We also showed that filtration was extremely poor (almost 0\%) for the cloth masks. Observations during SARS suggested double-masking and other practices increased the risk of infection because of moisture, liquid diffusion and pathogen retention. These effects may be associated with cloth masks.}
 \htmlp{Why am I focusing on this one weird study so much? Because it’s the only RCT of cloth face masks we have! Millions of people, egged on by top newspapers, are about to start wearing cloth face masks during a pandemic, when right now the authors of the only randomized trial on them conclude they’re probably net harmful. This should be really scary! Somebody with more experience and statistical knowledge than I have should be looking this over with a fine-toothed comb and trying to figure out what we should do.}
 \htmlp{Until then, should people stay away from cloth masks? I’m not sure, and this is } \htmli{so} not a recommendation, but I lean toward no. The prior that they should work or at least be neutral is too high for a study this weak to convince me otherwise.  \htmlb{More important, this study only examines incoming pathogens. Even if they are harmful for blocking incoming pathogens, there are still reasons to think they are helpful for blocking outgoing ones.} If I had to hang out with a coronavirus patient for a while, and I had to choose between both of us wearing cloth masks, or neither, I would go with the masks. Only until we could get real surgical masks, which are much better. But I’d go with the cloth ones instead of nothing.
 \htmlp{But right now that’s a gut judgment, and the evidence says I’m wrong. This is one of those times where people have to make a life-or-death decision in conditions of high uncertainty, and it really sucks.}

 \htmlp \htmlb{I.}
 \htmlp{The Clamzorians are animists. They believe every rock and tree and river has its own spirit. And those spirits are legal people. This on its own is not unusual – } \htmla{http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200319-the-new-zealand-river-that-became-a-legal-person}{even New Zealand} gives rivers legal personhood. But in Clamzoria, if a flood destroys your home, you sue the river.
 \htmlp{If you win, then the river is in debt to you. The government can assign a guardian to the river to force it to pay off its debts, and that guardian gets temporary custody of all the river’s property. He or she can collect a toll from boats, sell water to reservoirs, and charge rent to hydroelectric dams. Once the river has paid off its debt, the guardian is discharged, and the river becomes free to use once again.}
 \htmlp{Clamzorian precedent governs when you may or may not sue objects. If you swim in the freezing river in the dead of winter, and catch cold, that’s on you. But if a hurricane destroys your property, you can absolutely sue the wind for damages, and collect from windmills. Suits against earthquakes, volcanoes, and the like are dead common. Suits against diseases happen occasionally. Sometimes someone will sue something even more abstract – a custom, an emotion, a concept.}
 \htmlp{Legend tells of a lawyer who once sued Death itself for wrongful death, a class action suit on behalf of everyone who ever lived. The judge found in favor of the plaintiff, but the appointed custodian despaired at ever collecting the judgment – the few morticians and undertakers in the realm couldn’t afford even a fraction of the damages. In a stroke of genius, he went after the military, and charged them for the right to kill enemy soldiers. The military grumbled, but eventually gave in: fair is fair.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{II.}
 \htmlp{Fixed fines are inherently unfair to the poor. If you fine people \$50 for running a red light, you’ve charged someone who makes \$10,000 0.5\% of their income, but someone who makes \$100,000 gets off with only 0.05\% of their income.}
 \htmlp{But prison sentences are inherently unfair to the rich. After all, if you already live in a crowded slum much like a prison cell, and your life is prison-level boring and oppressive already, then going to prison barely costs you anything. But if you live in a mansion and spend all day indulging in the finest luxuries on offer, going to prison is a massive decrease in your quality of life.}
 \htmlp{The people of Pohjankaupunki thought long and hard about this problem, and came up with a solution: crimes will be punished by neither fines nor prison. They will be punished by government mandated prescription of rimonabant, a prodepressant medication which directly saps your ability to feel happiness. Running a red light may get you 5 mg rimonabant for a month. Murder may get you 80 mg rimonabant twice a day for ten years.}
 \htmlp{There is no capital punishment in Pohjankaupunki, but if a criminal decides to commit suicide rather than continue to take their medication, they are considered to have voluntarily upgraded to the death penalty, and their debt to the state has been repaid.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{III.}
 \htmlp{Sloviria is an enlightened country. They do not blame criminals for their actions. They realize it is Society’s fault for making criminals that way. So when someone commits a crime, they punish Society.}
 \htmlp{Sloviria is very technologically advanced, with plenty of social networking sites and GPS tracking of cell phones and all the other systems that create a nice objective social graph. When someone commits a crime, the government lets them go free, and punishes everyone else, in proportion to how close they were to the offender on the social graph. If the punishment for a certain crime is a \$1000 fine, perhaps each of their parents and their partner pays \$200, their boss and best friend pay \$100, some of their teachers a few tenners each, and more distant friends and relations a few dollars or less. If a friend of a friend who you met at a dinner party once commits murder, you may be out a couple of cents.}
 \htmlp{This isn’t to say perpetrators get off scot-free; Sloviria isn’t } \htmli{that} enlightened. The punishment for perpetrators is that nobody wants to interact with them, for fear that they might perpetrate again. Once a person is a known criminal – or a suspected criminal, or just the sort of person who seems like they might become a criminal – their friends, families, and business relations shun them, trying to minimize their potential loss. This threat alone is enough to discourage crime and every form of crime-adjacent misbehavior.
 \htmlp{The Slovirian Radical Party is even more enlightened than Sloviria as a whole, and opposes social punishment. They believe that such punishment prevents rehabilitation, since criminals and at-risk youth find it impossible to make the connections they need to succeed, and are forced to hang out with other people as criminal as themselves. They propose a complete inversion of Sloviria’s justice system; when anyone commits a crime, the people closest to them are } \htmli{rewarded}. They envision a future where, once somebody shows any sign of being at risk for antisocial behavior, they are love-bombed by dozens of people hoping to get rich off their acquaintance, people who want to employ them, adopt them, date them, or just serve as mentors and parental figures. But wouldn’t all these people encourage the potential criminal to offend? The Radicals debate this among themselves, with one solution being that  \htmli{this} could just be a perfectly normal crime punished by jail time.
 \htmlp \htmlb{IV.}
 \htmlp{Nova-Nishistan’s legal system is based on blackmail. It’s not } \htmli{just} blackmail. There are courts and jails and so on. But few people use them. If you have evidence that someone committed a crime, you are expected to threaten to report them unless they give you money.
 \htmlp{The system has many advantages. The person most likely to have evidence of a crime is the victim. The victim can choose how much money they want as damages, and have a good chance of receiving it. Fines are automatically calibrated to the wealth of the victim, so poor people are not stuck with debts that are impossible to pay. If a crime is victimless, or the victim chooses not to prosecute, any other witnesses are incentivized to take up the cause of punishing the wrongdoer of their own initiative. Few crimes make it to the courts or prisons, so everyone is assured a speedy trial and an jail cell free of overcrowding. }
 \htmlp{In order to maintain their system, the Nova-Nishistanis need many laws related to blackmail itself. One of their most serious crimes is to blackmail someone, receive the requested ransom, but report them anyway; anyone convicted of this will be in for a lengthy prison sentence. Indefinite blackmail – “pay me \$100 now, but I might ask for more later” – is forbidden. So is non-monetary blackmail; too easy to abuse. There are a host of similar regulations.}
 \htmlp{One regulation they don’t need is laws about retaliating against blackmailers. You might expect this to be a problem – blackmailing the mob sounds pretty scary. But there are lots of individuals, companies, and (let’s face it) rival gangs happy to provide dead-man’s-switch-as-a-service. Tell them your secret (which they promise not to disclose without your consent), and if anything happens to you, they prosecute it. Even better, if anything happens to you, they’re almost guaranteed to investigate your death, since their special evidence gives them a leg up in what could be a very lucrative blackmail case.}
 \htmlp{Of course, this only works on people who are rational enough to respond to incentives. If someone is a complete unpredictable psycho, you probably don’t want to try blackmailing them, even with a dead-man’s-switch as insurance. But these are probably the people who should be in jail anyway!}
 \htmlp \htmlb{V.}
 \htmlp{The people of Bogolia thought it was unfair that rich people could hire better lawyers than poor people. But they didn’t want to take the authoritarian step of banning rich people from buying good lawyers, if they thought skilled representation was important. Instead, they just mandated that in any legal case, both sides had to have equally-priced counsel. A rich person could hire as expensive a defense attorney as they wanted, as long as they donated an equal sum to the plaintiff to hire star attorneys of their own. You could sue someone with as highly-priced an attorney as you wanted, but you needed to give them the same amount to spend on their defense.}
 \htmlp{(this rule applied to the state too, and so implied the right to a public defender worth however much the state was paying to prosecute you, even if you were poor and couldn’t otherwise afford one)}
 \htmlp{Some trolls tried launching hundreds of frivolous lawsuits against companies they didn’t like, assuming that the company would have to pay both sides of the lawsuit and eventually go broke. They were punished through the normal anti-frivolous-lawsuit rules, and it turned out that companies that did not go broke having to pay one side of a lawsuit don’t go broke having to pay both sides either.}
 \htmlp{But there were some weirder unintended consequences. How good a lawyer to get became a highly strategic decision for rich clients facing poorer ones. If you thought you were in the right, you’d get a good lawyer, since two equally good lawyers facing off will likely produce truth. If you thought you were in the wrong, you’d try to get a crappy lawyer, since then your opponent would also have a crappy lawyer, and two crappy lawyers facing off will likely produce random results. Not paying for a good lawyer started to be seen as an admission that one’s case was weak.}
 \htmlp{But also, lawyer salaries started to get wacky. If a random criminal hurt a rich person somehow, and the rich person hired a good lawyer, the random criminal might receive tens of thousands of dollars to spend on legal advice. But random criminals generally are not savvy at evaluating lawyer skill, so thousands of predatory lawyers sprang up, willing to cater to these people by looking impressive and accepting very high salaries. For the savviest of political operators, an equal and opposite caste of underpriced lawyers sprang up, who would accept very low pay in exchange for vague social credit to be doled out later. More and more political scandals started to center on prestigious lawyers defending politicians for free in exchange for favors, and so depriving the opposing party of their right to equally-matched counsel.}
 \htmlp{Finally the authorities handed down a change to the system: the plaintiff and defendant would agree on two lawyers to conduct the trial. Then the judge would flip a coin, and one of the two would be assigned at random to each party.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{VI.}
 \htmlp{Sanzorre accidentally became } \htmla{https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/18/book-review-the-machinery-of-freedom/}{an anarcho-capitalist state} under the dominion of malpractice insurance companies.
 \htmlp{They started off by insuring doctors. Doctors know a bad malpractice case could ruin them. And although being a good doctor helps, it’s not 100\%. Even the best doctor can get unlucky, or have somebody with a grudge fabricate a case against them. For that matter, even very bad doctors can get lucky and never have to deal with a case at all. So doctors have malpractice insurance, and if they seem to be practicing medicine badly their insurance company will raise their premiums.}
 \htmlp{This worked well enough that other industries started adopting it too. If a factory’s pollutant byproducts got discovered to cause cancer ten years later, their industrial malpractice insurance would pay for it. If someone slipped and fell and broke their back on a restaurant floor, their restaurant malpractice insurance would pay for it. Of course, these insurance companies worked closely with factories to monitor how many they were polluting, and gave discounts to restaurants which followed best practices on floor cleaning.}
 \htmlp{Finally, they branched out to serving ordinary people. If you accidentally hit someone’s dog with your car and got sued for damages, better to have a personal malpractice insurance pay them than get hit for tens of thousands of dollars yourself. Having malpractice insurance became to Sanzorrians what having health insurance is to Americans – a necessity if you don’t want to court disaster.}
 \htmlp{The plaintiffs in all these cases were usually being covered by lawyers who took contigency fees. But as malpractice insurance companies became better at their jobs, the contingency fees began to dry up. Finally, lobbyists from the insurance companies got contingency fees banned entirely. This presented a dilemma for ordinary people with grievances against bad actors. Thus the rise of the grievance insurance.}
 \htmlp{If you suffered harm from a doctor’s medical error, and had grievance insurance, the insurance company would pay the cost of the malpractice suit. If you were poisoned by industrial runoff, the insurance company would pay the cost of suing the factory. Grievance insurance soon became as essential as malpractice insurance. Without it, you wouldn’t be able to stand up for your rights.}
 \htmlp{Like malpractice insurance, grievance insurance was only available cheaply to people who agreed to avoid risks. If you wanted to be able to sue for malpractice, you had to avoid going to quacks. If you wanted to be able to sue factories for pollution, you couldn’t live right next to a coal plant. Gradually, grievance insurances placed more and more restrictions on people’s behavior, and people generally complied.}
 \htmlp{As malpractice insurances incentivized potential defendants to avoid actions that could harm others, and grievance insurances incentivized individuals to avoid risk, the number of lawsuits gradually got fewer and fewer. Those that happened were generally settled between malpractice insurers and grievance insurers, without ever having to go to court, and sometimes with both companies changing their policy to avoid repeats in the future. Soon, even this formality was eliminated – each malpractice insurance company paid a negotiated amount to each grievance insurance company each year, and the grievance insurance company paid complainants from its own bank account as per its own policies whenever they complained.}
 \htmlp{It wasn’t quite full anarcho-capitalism. The state still intervened in a few very serious crimes, like murder. But the insurance companies had replaced the civil courts and the regulatory apparatus, and controlled every aspect of doing business.}
 \htmlp \htmlb{VII.}
 \htmlp{Modern philosophy says that formal systems are bunk. The dream of reducing the complexity of reality to some mere set of rules is a childish desire reminiscent of the fascists and high modernists of the early 20th century. Enlightened thinkers realize that we need a Kegan 5 type fluid ability to transcend systematicity. So the people of Mirakoth don’t have laws. They’re just supposed to not do bad stuff.}
 \htmlp{If someone in Mirakoth thinks someone else did something bad, they can bring it before a council of seven judges. If a majority of the judges think it was bad, they can assign whatever seems to them like fair punishment. If the loser appeals, it goes to a larger council of forty-nine judges. If they think it was bad, it was bad. These judges are under no obligation to follow precedent or any particular philosophy. They’re just supposed to be in favor of good stuff and against bad stuff.}
 \htmlp{In order to prevent people from seeking out judges who agree with them, each case is assigned seven judges at random. All cases are tried by videoconference, to make sure the judge pool is unlimited by geographical mobility. If the judges think a case is frivolous, they can choose to punish the person who brought the case.}
 \htmlp{Doesn’t this create such paralyzing uncertainty that nobody knows if they can do anything at all? Not really. Controversial cases are more likely to go to the full 49 judge panel. If an opinion is only held by 20\% of judges in the country, then there’s only about a 1 in a million chance that the panel will rule in favor. Even if the opinion is held by 40\%, it’s still only an 8\% chance of winning. So just don’t do things that more than 40\% of people think are bad, and you’ll be fine!}}
