# Chicago Apartment Hunting on Craigslist and Other Platforms

Our goal is to write a program that will use the web APIs of different apartment listing aggregators and report based on different criteria how good of a fit they are. We will use a variety of APIs to collect listings and then make a rating system.

## Aggregation

Aggregation will come from the following sources:

* Craigslist
* Apartments.com
* Domu

APIs have yet to be discovered, except for Craigslist which will be through its search RSS feed.

## Processing

The needed data will be stored in JSON after preprocessing (sorting out info from API results). If needed, other APIs will be implemented for tracking other relevant data (distance from campus, etc.)

## Front End

Perhaps a webpage, but maybe an Excel spreadsheet for more user interactivity. I know my mother will like having that.
